In order to use the flask backend server:

1. Create a python virtual environment in the flask_backend folder: **python -m venv venv**
2. Activate the virtual environment:                                **venv/Scripts/activate**
3. Install flask and python-dotenv to the virtual environment:      **pip install flask python-dotenv**
4. (Optional) Navigate back to the meet-me-half-way folder:         **cd ..**
5. Activate the flask backend:                                      **npm run start-flask**

**Important Note:** The flask server must be started within the python virtual environment where flask and dotenv are installed.

To deactivate the virtual environment simply type 'deactive' in the command line when you are finished testing/developing.
This can all be done in vscode terminals.
